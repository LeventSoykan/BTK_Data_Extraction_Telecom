BTK Data Extraction Telecom
===========================

This project aims to extract data from a large telecom dataset using Python and the Pandas library. The raw data is in CSV format and contains information on customer calls, text messages, and data usage.

The project is broken down into the following steps:

1.  **Data Cleaning:** The raw data is cleaned using Python and the Pandas library. The data is inspected for any missing values, duplicates, and inconsistencies. The cleaned data is then stored in a new CSV file.
    
2.  **Data Extraction:** The cleaned data is then used to extract specific information such as the total number of calls made, the total number of text messages sent, and the total amount of data used. This information is then stored in a new CSV file.

* Data extraction and merge using BeautifulSoup & Pandas
* Analysis using PowerBI
